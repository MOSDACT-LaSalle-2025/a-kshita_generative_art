Description: This piece is a self-made sky. Random stars are scattered, but only sometimes connect to close neighbors. Out of those simple rules, constellations briefly emerge, then fade. It balances order and chance: connections form patterns we recognize, then dissolve into memory.

There’s a human layer, too. We’re wired for pareidolia—we want to find meaning in noise. As connections appear, we can’t help but read shapes, paths, and stories into the sky. Nothing is actually “there,” yet we recognize patterns anyway. To me, that says something about how we navigate the world: we make constellations out of randomness, together.
